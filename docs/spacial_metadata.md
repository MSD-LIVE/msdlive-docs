# Spatial Metadata

Adding spatial metadata helps downstream users understand where your data was collected or applied.

## Selecting Common Locations
This video shows you how to add commonly used locations (for example, the Contiguous United States or 'CONUS') to your draft dataset. It also shows how you can search the MSD-LIVE data repository catalog for data in a specific location:

You can also enter custom locations if you need to define the spatial coverage yourself:
