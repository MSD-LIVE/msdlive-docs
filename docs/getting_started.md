# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to **MSD-LIVE**, a one-stop shop for finding software, data, workflows, and tools used by the [MultiSector Dynamics Community](https://multisectordynamics.org/).  
This page describes the basic steps needed to get started working with MSD-LIVE resources.  
For more information about MSD-LIVE and our team, please see the [**About**](https://msdlive.org/about) page.

Many improvements and new features are planned throughout the next year, so please check back periodically to learn about all the latest changes!

## Step 1: Create an Account

MSD-LIVE user accounts are managed by the Amazon Cognito Identity Management System so that access can be shared across all MSD-LIVE products and services.

Please go to the [**Sign Up**](https://msdlive.org/sign-up) page to create a new account.

If you can't remember your password or aren't sure whether you have an account:

- Go to the [**Forgot Password**](https://msdlive.org/forgot-password) page  
- Enter your email  

If you have an account, you will receive a link to reset your password.  
If you don’t have an account, it will let you know and direct you to the Sign Up page.

## Step 2: Log In

If you are part of the MSD community, please make sure to [**Log In**](https://msdlive.org/disclaimer?urlToContinue=https://data.msdlive.org/oauth/login/cognito/?next=https%253A%252F%252Fmsdlive.org%252Fget-started&urlToGoBack=https://msdlive.org/get-started) before interacting with MSD-LIVE websites to ensure you have access to all available functionality.

A login is not required to browse the data repository or download data from MSD-LIVE.

---

## Step 3: Join a Project

To upload datasets or set up compute resources, you MUST belong to at least one MSD-LIVE project.  
MSD-LIVE projects directly map to MSD projects such as IM3 and PCHES.

Please browse the [**Projects**](https://msdlive.org/projects) page to see the current list of projects.  
If you see a "Join" button next to a project, you may request membership.

You will be notified when your request is approved.

If you need a new project created, please email: [**info@msdlive.org**](mailto:info@msdlive.org)

## Step 4: Publish Code or Data

If you have project datasets or code to share with the MSD-LIVE community or the general public, you can upload them to the [**Data Repository**](https://data.msdlive.org/uploads/new).

Our upload form provides a rich set of metadata to help others find your data. It also gives you the opportunity to mint a DOI for your data if desired.
In order to upload data, you must belong to at least one project and the dataset must be directly funded by and relevant to that project.
When uploading your data, you must select one or more projects to associate your submission with, and one project is also assigned the special role of "Reviewing Project".

A curator from the Reviewing Project will verify that your submission meets [**MSD-LIVE Policies**](https://msdlive.org/policies) and follows best practices.

You may mark submissions as:

- **Public** — visible to everyone  
- **Restricted** — visible only to members of the associated projects  

The MSD-LIVE Data Repository is built upon the [**Invenio Research Data Management (RDM) platform**](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/), which is in turn based upon a refactoring of the popular [**Zenodo research data repository**](https://zenodo.org/).  
Many new RDM features are planned over the next year and, where appropriate, we will incorporate them into the MSD-LIVE Data Repository as soon as they are released.

## Step 5: Find Data

Please go the the Data Repository's [**Search**](https://data.msdlive.org/search) page to find data or code to use for your research. The search page allows you to search across all the datasets and code stored in MSD-LIVE using the same metadata properties captured in the upload form. Note that you will only be able to see datasets for which you have the correct permissions. Over the next year we are working to add the ability to connect data hosted in the Data Repository to cloud computing resources in MSD-LIVE.

---

## Step 6: Set Up Compute Resources

As the core MSD-LIVE infrastructure is built on top of the AWS cloud, we can provide the ability to quickly provision scalable compute resources for your project's needs. This can include things like Jupyter Hub/Jupyter Notebooks for demos, workshops, or research, web application frameworks, and scalable compute clusters for running models or analytics. Because cloud resources are provisioned via reusable templates, this reduces the time to set up such resources to a matter of minutes. Over time, MSD-LIVE will be adding more and more templates tailored to the MSD community. Please see the [**Computational Resources**](https://msdlive.org/computational-resources) page for more information including a list of our current offerings.

## Step 7: Get Help

Visit the [**Resources**](https://msdlive.org/help/resources) page for instructional videos explaining MSD-LIVE components and best practices.

If you encounter issues or need support, check the [**Help**](https://msdlive-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page for known issues or contact the MSD-LIVE team.
